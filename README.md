## Setup
1. You have to install Docker for running this app -> [link](https://www.docker.com/get-started);
2. Please download docker image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ichal6/common-files-server):
```shell
docker pull ichal6/common-files-server
```
> **If you want to create a local Docker image or run program without Docker, make these instructions:**
> 1. Install a local version of MongoDB: [instructions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)
> 2. After this you can use run program from maven:
> ```shell
> mvn package -P dev
> ```
> This command prepare *jar* file with an application in folder target.
> 3. You can run program from command:
> ```shell
> java -Dspring.profiles.active=docker -jar [NAME OF JAR FILE].jar
> ```
> 4. Now you can build a Docker image:
> ```shell
> docker build . -t cf-server
> ```

3. In the next step please open terminal in main directory of project and provide:
```shell
docker-compose build 
docker-compose up
```
- **If you run this at the first time program need more time and Internet connection!**

4. Please wait a moment (program need a time for initialize) and insert in your web browser **http://localhost:8080/**
